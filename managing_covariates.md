Collecting and Managing Covariate Data
================

Forecasts make projections in to the future by modeling relationships
among covariates in the past. Collecting and managing historical records
can be a challenging task, especially if the forecast is made with a
variety of datasets.

## Collecting Covariate Data

Seriously, we aren’t going to talk about this. There are too many
resources out on the world wild web for us to spend any time thinking
about this. If you need data, you’ll figure out how to get it.

Getting data is not the problem. Storing and managing data is the
problem.

## Managing Covariate Data

### Size matters

Do you really need the entire globe? Do you need every variable? Storage
costs, duplicate storage cost double.

### Compress?

Compressing saves disk space, but adds computational effort. Decide
early what the cost/benefit is for your workflows.

### Filenames

Preserve original names, and append with meta-info as needed.

### Organize

Computers navigate hierarchical directory structures with ease. Leverage
that to organize your local dataset with appropriate granularity.
